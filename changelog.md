Here’s a **changelog** summarizing all the major changes made to your project in the last two hours:

---

**Changelog: Last Two Hours**

### **1. Migration from Tailwind CSS to Material-UI (MUI)**
- **Removed all Tailwind CSS dependencies, configuration, and classes** from the project.
- **Installed and configured Material-UI (MUI)** as the new design system.
- Updated the global styles and theme to use MUI’s `ThemeProvider` and `CssBaseline`.

---

### **2. MUI Theme Customization**
- Created a custom MUI theme (`src/theme.ts`) with:
  - Linstol red as the primary color.
  - Light gray backgrounds for cards.
  - Custom typography and button styles.
  - AppBar and Paper component overrides for a modern, branded look.

---

### **3. Layout and Component Refactoring**
- **Refactored the main page layout** (`src/app/page.tsx`) to use MUI components (`Box`, `Container`, `AppBar`, `Toolbar`, etc.).
- Ensured the layout is responsive and visually consistent with the new theme.

---

### **4. Search Form Redesign**
- **Completely rebuilt the `SearchOptions` component** to use MUI’s Grid system for layout.
- Made all input fields the same size and aligned them in a symmetrical, 3-column grid.
- Moved the Search and Clear buttons below the input fields, spanning the full width.
- Added light spacing between all input boxes for a clean, modern look.

---

### **5. MUI v7 Migration**
- **Upgraded all MUI packages to v7** (`@mui/material`, `@mui/system`, `@mui/icons-material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`).
- **Migrated all Grid usage to the new MUI v7 API:**
  - Removed deprecated `item`, `container`, `xs`, and `md` props.
  - Used `columns`, `rowSpacing`, `columnSpacing`, and CSS grid properties for layout.
  - Updated all relevant imports and usage patterns.

---

### **6. Linter and Runtime Error Fixes**
- Fixed all linter and type errors related to MUI Grid usage.
- Ensured all components are compatible with the latest MUI and Next.js versions.
- Removed all references to deprecated or missing files (e.g., `ThemeRegistry`).

---

### **7. General Improvements**
